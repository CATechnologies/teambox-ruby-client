This is a Ruby wrapper for Teambox API.

Largely inspired by @jnunemaker's Twitter gem.
This is currently in development, and is missing many methods.

Examples
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, create a file on $HOME/.teambox with these values:

    username: your_teambox_username_or_email
    password: password

See the examples directory.
